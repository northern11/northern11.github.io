title: "Updating the Blog, Searching for Motivation"

After another pause I've finally gotten back to working on the blog. I had to fix a few things and I've learned that you don't mess
with the "Front Matter" or it won't load the page properly on the blog. One issue was the Home page wasn't loading style layout. 
The fix was changing the "Front Matter" of the file. I had an HTML comment in the Front Matter and after removing that things worked
the way they should. Another issue was a post was missing from the blog and it was related to the Front Matter as well.

I'm still having trouble consistently coding and I'm trying to find discipline and motivation to make progress. I think the issue
is I'm trying to do too many things at once and I need to focus on one thing and suck it up. 

Things I still want to do to this blog.
1. Change the template or layout
2. Implement Jekyll
3. Add Google Analytics
