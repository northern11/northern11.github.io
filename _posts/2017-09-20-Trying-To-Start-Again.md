So back on the 19th of August I was so gung-ho about starting up #100DaysofCode and hoping I could start a streak that I could
continue for a 100 days and ever more... That clearly didn't happen.

ProTip: Don't start a commitment journey right before closing on a house (1st of September) and then moving into that house and
putting together all of your lego (IKEA) furniture and after the house is somewhat situated you go to a friends wedding for the
weekend. All-in-all these are just excuses and I have to build good habits.

Over my trip I was able to finish reading the [YDKJS: Up & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going)
and get into a little bit of the second book [YDKJS: Scope and Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures)
and it is blowing my mind! I'm defintely going to have to re-read these books more than once to understand it.

So currently where I am at now...

* Started the p1xt Job Ready Guide
    * Readying YDKJS: Scope and Closures
    * Started Harvard CS50x course on edx

Things to do...
* Finish Footer on Cohort Page
* Create a Learning Plan or Schedule
* Fix this blog CSS and flesh it out with Jekyll
* Start #100DaysofCode again

What I need to do is create a schedule plan with goal dates when I plan to finish certain items. Definitely going to use [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-got-a-second-degree-and-earned-5-developer-certifications-in-just-one-year-while-working-and-2b902ee291ab)
guy as inspiration. I talked to Chance earlier and he said one of the best things to do would be to build a habit, something easy like
exercising, and go from there.
