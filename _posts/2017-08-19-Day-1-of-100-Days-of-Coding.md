I'm making it official! Today is going to be my first day of the 100 Days of Code journey I am starting. I've already
been trying to learn React.js as part of a Chingu Cohort. The result of that project can be found at 
this [link](https://quiet-depths-19003.herokuapp.com/). It has been a struggle trying to learn and I've found out that
I need to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS better. Today I added the footer to that page, but the styling is off and needs
to be fixed. By the way here the the rules for the 100 Days of Code Journey:

1. I will code for at least an hour every day.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and note which day of the challenge I’m on.
3. I will fork the #100DaysOfCode repository to my GitHub account, then track my progress there
4. If I code as part of my job, I will not count that time towards the challenge.
5. I will only count the days where I spend at least some of my time building projects — not the days where I spend all my coding time working through lessons and tutorials. (If you’re new to coding, Free Code Camp’s curriculum quickly ramps up to building projects, and you will have built dozens of projects by the time you finish it).
6. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfCode challenge on Twitter.
7. I will only skip a day if something important comes up. And when I resume, I won’t count the day I skipped as one of my 100 days.

Heres hoping I keep the streak alive!!
